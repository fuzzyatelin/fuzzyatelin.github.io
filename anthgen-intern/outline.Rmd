### **Week 01 (January 22, 2024)**
***

#### An Introduction to the SMAGL Internship

##### Topics for Discussion

We'll discuss general expectations for the course, required trainings and approvals for lab access, and the projects we'll be working on throughout the semester.

##### Lab Practicum

**SMAGL Wet Lab Orientation**: we will walk through the [SMAGL Wet Lab](https://www.bu.edu/anthrop/research/laboratories/sensory-morphology-and-genomic-anthropology-lab-smgal/) and go over the basics of the space, including basic lab safety and etiquette, assign and discuss PPE, and go over what is and is not accessible to you while conducting this internship.

##### SMAGL Lab Meeting

**Introductory Lab Meeting**: we will meet the other members of the SMAGL at our first lab meeting of the semester! Please come prepared to share your goals for the semester, and to set your goals for the coming week.

##### Required Readings

**Mandatory Lab Trainings**: you have already been added to the SMAGL Schmitt Lab on [BioRAFT](https://www.bu.edu/ehs/ehs-topics/about-bioraft/), and have several associated trainigs that are **required** for you to complete **prior to** entering the wet bench space in STO 251. **Please complete these before Monday, January 22!**

### **Week 02 (January 29, 2024)**

#### Introduction to Molecular Genetics

##### Topics for Discussion

We'll discuss the basics of molecular genetics - what is DNA and RNA, what is a gene and how does it work, and a brief history of molecular genetics techniques.

##### Lab Practicum

It's time to pipette!  We'll learn some *very* basic lab skills in the wet lab today, including how to clean up a work bench, how to run the BSC, how to run the UV hoods, and how to run the autoclave.

##### SMAGL Lab Meeting

Schmitt Lab first-year Ph.D. student Jimmy Erkens will be introducing us to the green monkeys (*Chlorocebus sabaeus*) of St. Kitts & Nevis this week!

#### The Basics of Doing Genetics

##### Topics for Discussion

We'll discuss an overview of the basics of genetics lab work - from extraction to sequencing, with a focus on some key methodological considerations for the generation of DNA sequences critical for analyses relevant to the projects we plan on doing this semester.

##### Lab Practicum

This week in lab, we'll go over the basics of where things are in the lab that we'll use in our projects this semester, and why. We'll look briefly at relevant protocols, and identify and discuss potential issues with workflow in the lab before, in the coming weeks, diving into actual labwork!

##### SMAGL Lab Meeting
