## An Introduction to Science Communication

***

For the rest of Discussion in CAS AN/WS 233, we are going to shift gears. Previous Discussions introduced you to evolution, the science of biological variation, and an overview of the current scientific understanding of human genetic variation and adaptation. Over the last few weeks in your discussion section, you explored the entanglement of science and society through *Sex/Gender* and the history of Henrietta Lacks and what happened to her family and to her cells. A thread that kept appearing in the books *Sex/Gender* and *The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks* is the break-down in communication between scientists and non-scientists. As we move into the history of the science of human biological variation in lecture, you will see more examples of how science, and society's understanding and utilization of that science are much more intertwined, and much less objective than any of us would like. 

For the rest of your discussion sections this semester, you will explore science communication and give it a try yourself. There is no better way to understand a process than to experience it first-hand! Over the course of the next five weeks, you'll develop a piece of science communication (SciComm). The building blocks of the project will be guided through your discussion sections, and the final project will be complete by the last day of class, where you will provide a brief presentation of your SciComm project to the class during lecture. On the final exam, you will be asked to write a brief final essay reflecting on your SciComm project. Follow the link here for [Expectations](https://fuzzyatelin.github.io/scicomm/expectations.html) for the assignment.

Our hope is that this opportunity helps you develop an eye for recognizing when science communication is as unbiased as possible, and for when it is, well, when it doesn't live up to the ideal. This is a critical-thinking skill that will serve you well, far beyond this course.

There are many different forms of science communication. These range from primary sources of scientific information - such as primary literature reviews, and of course primate research itself - to works we typically think of as science communication (often shortened to SciComm), which communicate and *translate* the primary scientific literature to audiences who may not be scientists. These latter forms of science communcation may include podcasts, documentaries, short videos (TikTok, YouTube), infographics, interviews, newspaper articles, magazine articles, Instagram posts, books, and more. 

In preparation for the CAS AN/WS 233 Discussion Sections for the month of April, please take some time to engage with four different types of SciComm that we’ve pulled together for you. There are links to each, below:

<br>

1. **Infographic** (3-5 minutes to read)

<br>

<center>

[**CDC, "Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Heart Disease"**](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hus/spotlight/2019-heart-disease-disparities.htm)

</center>

<br>

2. **Magazine Article** (5-10 minutes to read)

<br>

<center>

[**Ed Yong, *The Atlantic*, "No, Scientists Have Not Found the ‘Gay Gene’"**](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/10/no-scientists-have-not-found-the-gay-gene/410059/)

</center>

<br>

3. **Podcast** (31 minutes to listen)

<br>

<center>

[**Janina M. Jeff, *In Those Genes*, Episode: "Up in Dem Genes"**](https://inthosegenes.com/listen-1)

</center>

<br>

4. **Popular SciComm** (20 mintues)

<br>

<center>

[**John Oliver, *Last Week Tonight*, Episode: "Gene Editing"**](https://youtu.be/AJm8PeWkiEU)

</center>

<br>

Before you engage with each of these media types, please go to the course [Blackboard](https://learn.bu.edu) and download the SciComm Worksheet. Fill it out while you're reading/watching the media.

In the SciComm worksheet, you'll note *one strength* and *one drawback* for each particular type of media. Aim to write just 2-3 sentences for each strength and each drawback (this assignment need not be an essay; just give us your critical impression). These strengths and drawbacks could relate to any aspect of the science communication piece that struck you, such as: the way the information is portrayed, the biases (or lack thereof) of the information, any political or personal slant detected, accessibility aspects, and more that may have influenced how the SciComm affected what you took from it.

We anticipate that it will take you no more than 70 minutes to complete this assignment, including engaging with the different media formats.

You can find the remaining discussion section assignments related to the SciComm project below!
