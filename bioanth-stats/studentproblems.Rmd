We won't have time to work together on *every* problem that crops up in class, but we can help each other out!  If you ever run into a road block in a Module or Challenge, the first thing you should do is check your syntax or spelling (this is usually the problem if you're a beginner). The next step is to **consult the textbooks**! Nine times out of ten they've got the solution, or can help you get to it. The next step is to *google* the problem. I suggest starting by throwing quotation marks around the error message, pasting it into your search engine of choice with the name of the package, and searching that way. If, after a few unproductive hours, you feel like tearing your hair out, then create an ***R Markdown*** file and completely describe the problem, complete with reproducible R code blocks, knitting it together as an html file, and uploade it to the **AN597_StudentProblems** repository on my ***GitHub*** account, **fuzzatelin**. See the instructions below for more details.

But always remember your most effective and important resource:

So you want to contribute to the **AN597_InsurmountableProblems** repository? OK, here we go...

## I will add you as a collaborator to the *AN597_InsurmountableProblems* repository.

That actually should be sufficient. You'll receive an email from me inviting you to collaborate. Accept it, and you should be able to work with the repository as you like.

***

***IF*** that doesn't work, you'll have to do the following steps:

* Go to the repository on ***GitHub***, you'll find it [here](https://github.com/fuzzyatelin/AN597_StudentProblems) (make sure you're signed in to your account!).
* Click the "Fork" button at the top right.
* You should now have your own copy of that repository in your own ***GitHub*** account.
* Open a terminal/shell.
* Type:
```{bash,eval=FALSE}
git clone git@github.com:username/AN597_StudentProblems
```
(In this case, the 'username' is *your* ***GitHub*** username)
* You'll now have a local copy of *your version* of that repository.
* Change into that project directory (AN597_StudentProblems):
```{bash,eval=FALSE}
cd AN597_StudentProblems
```
* Add a connection to the original owner's (my) repository:
```{bash,eval=FALSE}
git remote add fuzzyatelin git://github.com/fuzzyatelin/AN597_StudentProblems
```
* Note the distinction between `git@github.com:` in the first case and `git://github.com/` in the second case. I’m not sure why these need to be the way they are, but that’s what works for me.
* Also note the first myfriend does not need to be the same as the username of myfriend. You could very well choose:
```{bash,eval=FALSE}
git remote add REPO_nickname git://github.com/fuzzyatelin/AN597_StudentProblems
```
* To check this remote add set up:
```{bash,eval=FALSE}
git remote -v
```
* Make changes to files
* `git add` and `git commit` those changes
git push them back to ***GitHub***. These will go to *your version* of the repository.

##Handling pull requests
Say I've made some changes to your code. When I do, you'll get an email about it at the email address to which your ***GitHub*** account is registered.
**Using the *GitHub* website**

* Go to your version of the repository.
* Click on “Pull Requests” at the top.
* Click on the particular request.
* You’ll see their comments on the pull request, and can click to see the exact changes.
* If you want them to make further changes before you merge the changes into your repository, add a comment.
* If you hate the whole idea, just click the “Close” button.
* If you want to merge the changes into your repository, click the “Merge pull request” button.
* Your repository will now be fixed, but you’ll want to get them into your local repository, too, so either pull the changes from ***GitHub*** using whatever means you use to interface with your desktop files (***RStudio*** or ***GitHub Desktop***)
