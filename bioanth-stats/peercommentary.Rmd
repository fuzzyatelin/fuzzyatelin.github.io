The Peer Commentary assignment is one of the most important exercises in this class. It's a chance for you to work *with* your classmates to learn different perspectives on approaching and coding statistics while also engaging in respectful feedback about the ways in which your peers code, comment their code, and work through coding and statistical problems.

(Please... no Bianca Del Rio-level shade in this class; we'll *all* be making mistakes this semester).

###**How it works...**

Every week, after you've finished the [Homework]() associated with your assigned [Module](https://fuzzyatelin.github.io/bioanth-stats/modules.html), you will be required to share your annoted/commented code with your weekly assigned Peer Group. At the end of your Homework Code, in a section labeled **CHALLENGES**, you will share a list of the 5 five most difficult challenges you faced in writing your code, and what you did to overcome them. The Peer Group you share this code with will typically be a group of three, although depending on final class size it may be a group of two, and this group will change on a weekly basis (see below for your assigned groups). **You must send your commented/annotated code from your Homework to your Peer Group by 8:00 pm on Thursday night**. It is up to your group whether one or both of the other members work together to respectfully critique the others' code, and groups are encouraged to meet over the weekend to discuss their code.

###**What you're critiquing...**

As noted in the [Homework]() instructions, while completing your homework each of you will compile a list of the five most impactful challenges faced while coding it, along with how you overcame them (or what you attempted if you couldn't overcome them). You, as a peer commenter, must spend *at least an hour* reviewing and testing your peer's code with an eye towards understanding the challenges they faced, and in the process write down the following:
<br><ol>
1. What you learned from running their code that helped improve your own code.
2. What you did in your own code that might help to improve theirs.
3. What challenges, if any, you *both* faced in your code that could not be helped by comparison.
4. Whether the annotation/commenting on your peer's code is readable and interpretable to you, and if not then how it could be improved.
</ol>
Although not required, you are encouraged to meet outside class so that you may work together on this process.

Ideally, as peer commenter you will give your comments back to the original coder in time for them to take into account your comments and turn in a corrected (and hopefully function) Final Homework.

**Students must turn in their Original Homework Code (with Challenges noted), Peer Commentaries, and Final Homework Code to me by 5:00 pm on Sunday**

In class, for 10 minutes, you will be given a chance to meet with your Peer Group in order to prioritize questions or challenges that your group would like to bring to the attention of the whole class.

We will then take 30 minutes of each class to address these challenges together, and see if other Peer Groups faced similar challanges or found unique solutions to each problem, and together will do our best to solve them.

Although grades will not be assigned for Peer Commentaries, if it comes to my attention that particular students are not actively participating in this process, it will be considered when negotiating their argument for their final grade.
