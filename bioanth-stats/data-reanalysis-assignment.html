<p>Replication is meant to be one of the keystones of scientific
inquiry. Every experiment, observation, or analysis <em>should</em> be
replicable by any other scientist, if we’ve all done our jobs right. The
objective of this assignment is to use your skills in
<strong><em>R</em></strong> to replicate as closely as you can a set of
statistical analyses and results reported in a published paper of your
choosing.</p>
<p>You should select and confirm with me a paper and dataset you will
replicate by <strong>February 18, 2025</strong>!</p>
<p>You do not need to replicate ALL of the analyses presented in the
paper, <em>but at minimum you must replicate at least 3 analyses</em>,
including at least one <em>descriptive</em> statistical analysis and one
<em>inferential</em> statistical analysis. As part of this assignment,
you must also replicate to the best of your abilities at least one
figure.</p>
For this assignment, you should prepare several files to share with me
via <strong><em>GitHub</em></strong> in a new repo, shared with me as a
collaborator, called “<strong>BUlogin-AN588-Replication</strong>”:
<ol>
<li>
A PDF copy of the paper from which you are replicating analyses.
</li>
<li>
A <code>.csv</code> file (you can make this in Excel) with the original
data for that paper.
</li>
<li>
An <code>.Rmd</code> file where you thoroughly describe and run the code
for all of the steps in your replication. I should be able to take the
<code>.Rmd</code> file along with the <code>.csv</code> file and knit it
to produce a nicely formatted <code>.html</code> report describing what
you did and in which I can easily see your results.
</li>
</ol>
<p>You should also embed in your <code>.Rmd</code> file, near your own
results, any images or figures from the original paper that you
replicate so that I can see them together. These should be included as
<code>.png</code> files in a folder called “img” within your repo. You
can include code like the following to reference files in your “img”
folder for inclusion in your document.</p>
<p><code>&lt;img src="img/imagename.filetype" width="###px"/&gt;</code></p>
<p>Where you replace <em>imagename.filetype</em> with the name of your
file, e.g., “figure-1.png” and <em>###</em> with a integer number of
pixels, e.g., width=“200px”.</p>
<p>A simpler option with fewer formatting possibilities is to include
the picture using this markdown code:</p>
<p><code>![](img/imagename.filetype)</code></p>
<p>If you include the following chunk at the beginning of your Rmd
document with the headline <code>{r setup, include=FALSE}</code> (which
lays out for <strong><em>R</em></strong> a particular set of
instructions for knitting), it will ensure that all of the figures
created by your chunks of code when it knits will be put directly into
the “img” folder:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>&gt; knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, comment = &quot;##&quot;, prompt = TRUE,
+     tidy = TRUE, tidy.opts = list(width.cutoff = 75), fig.path = &quot;img/&quot;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="elements-of-your-report" class="section level2">
<h2>Elements of Your Report</h2>
<p>You should start your replication report with a short description of
the study and of the specific data and replication analyses you will be
performing, to orient your reader. Outline (briefly) the goal of the
original paper, the data set used, and the analyses conducted, then
describe which you will replicate. You should also demonstrate how you
read your datafile into <strong><em>R</em></strong>, and show a few
lines of raw data in your output (e.g., using <code>head()</code>).</p>
<p>I will be looking for you to clearly take your reader through all of
the elements of data manipulation, analysis, and, where appropriate,
visualization. You should provide as much coding detail, explanation,
and output tables as necessary to compare your results to those
published.</p>
<p>Annotate your code well, and good luck!</p>

<h2>Example Replication Assignments</h2>
<p>For some excellent examples of past assignments, see <a
href="https://fuzzyatelin.github.io/bioanth-stats/jung_replication.html">here</a>

<div id="where-to-find-data-and-their-associated-paper"
class="section level2">
<h2>Where to find data (and their associated paper)</h2>
<p>Students in the past have had a lot of trouble actually
<em>finding</em> a relevant article that has associated open-access data
available online. This makes replication much more difficult, and is
increasingly frowned upon by the scientific community, but is often the
standard operating procedure in the sciences (especially when data are
proprietary). However, there is <a
href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/how-freely-should-scientists-share-their-data/">much
debate about</a> and increasing calls for open-access data, both for
replication and more general equity purposes. The <a
href="https://www.nsf.gov/data/">National Science Foundation</a>, for
example, requires that there be a data management plan including the
depositing of data generated by NSF-funded research in public
repositories.</p>
<p>Rather than searching for a paper you like and finding that the
authors have - for various reasons - not made their data public, you can
instead search a public data repository relevant to your field for an
appropriate dataset along with the associated published paper. The
journal <em>Nature</em> has pulled together links for several such
repositories <a
href="https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories#general">at
this handy website</a>.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend starting your search at <a
href="https://datadryad.org/stash">Dryad</a>. This is a general purpose
scientific data repository that is pretty well-liked and well-used by
biolgoical anthropologists and biologists more generally.</p>
<p>For example, if I were interested in doing research on the primate
microbiome for my thesis, and so wanted to learn a bit more about the
methods and the baboon (genus <em>Papio</em>) microbiome by replicating
a study on it, I would enter the following into the Dryad
<code>Explore Data</code> tab:</p>
<p><br><br> <img src="img/dryad_search1.png" /></p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>Upon pressing <code>Search</code>, it will take me to every dataset
in Dryad that’s flagged for those two search terms (<code>Papio</code>
and <code>microbiome</code>):</p>
<p><br><br> <img src="img/dryad_search2.png" /></p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>As you can see, there are quite a few! If I’m more interested in
social behavior, I might choose the second option on the list by
clicking on the title of the dataset (i.e.,
<code>Data from: Social networks predict...</code>), which will take me
to the individual data page for that particular dataset:</p>
<p><br><br> <img src="img/dryad_search3.png" /></p>
<p><br><br> On the data page, I can read an abstract of the article
associated with the data (to see if it’s what I’m looking for),
access/download the data as the authors have uploaded it to the
repository (see the arrow in green, above; note that some datasets may
have multiple versions of the data… in such cases, I recommend
downloading the most recent!), and also the you can follow a link to the
published article (see the arrow in blue, above).</p>
<p>You probably won’t find a paper that interests you on the first
search, but that’s ok. It takes some time to find a paper that both
interests you AND contains the kinds of analyses that you 1) would like
to replicate, and 2) are actually <em>prepared</em> to replicate.</p>
<p>Please keep that latter point in mind: <strong>do not try to
replicate something that is too far out of your depth!</strong> Think
about what you’ve learned (or will learn) in this class and take it from
there. If the above paper uses methods you’re not familiar with with
(like social network analysis and microbiome analysis), you can check
for other modules on the course webpage to see if you can figure it out
(for example, there <em>is</em> a Social Network Analysis module…
<em>but</em> we do not learn how to analyze microbiome data in this
course).</p>
<p>If you want to treat yourself nicely (and we all should) and avoid
anxiety (which we all want to do), it would probably be best for you to
find another paper with analyses that you <em>will</em> be able to
replicate given the tools I’ll help you learn in this course via the
standard modules (regression, mixed models, etc).</p>
<p>Additionally, very often authors <em>say</em> they’ve posted open
access data - and there is, indeed, a file posted on <em>Dryad</em> -
but when you download the file it may turn out to be a huge,
incomprehensible mess or in a format that requires proprietary programs
to access. Sadly, this is very common. Make sure to actually inspect the
data after downloading it to see if you can figure out which variables
are where, and to ensure you can envision <em>how</em> you would
practically use these data to replicate the analyses in the paper. This
is where students often realize they may have to change papers, so make
sure to do this before committing to a replication! If you think it’s
close to what you want, but you’re not yet sure (for example, if there’s
a mixed model and you’re unsure of what you’ll need for it since the
module is in April!)… come to my office hours and I’ll help you figure
out if it’s appropriate.</p>
