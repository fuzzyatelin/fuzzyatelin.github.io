###Course Description
***
<p>
<img src=https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/p_values.png style="float:right" width="180" hspace="20">
Statistical methods are the backbone of scientific research, but are often given short shrift when designing research in biological anthropology. The purpose of this seminar is two-fold: 1) to familiarize students with the use of relevant statistical programming packages (primarily R), and 2) to discuss select advances in statistical techniques from related disciplines that may help students while designing and implementing their own research projects. 

Potential foci of discussion may include statistical methods for accounting for small sample sizes or non-normal data, using power analyses and preliminary statistics to justify data collection design, and the use of mixed models and information theoretic approaches to analyze a number of different data types. Although there will be a discussion element to the seminar, students should see this course as a guided workshop or practicum in which we learn by working with both our own and previously published datasets.

This course is open to students outside of Anthropology willing to learn the methods involved. Past students include undergraduate and graduate students from Anthropology, Archaeology, Biology, and Economics.

###Prerequisites
***
CAS AN 102 or CAS BI 107/108 (for undergraduates) or graduate student standing, and/or consent of instructor. At least one semester of introductory statistics is recommended, but not required. Prior experience programming is helpful, but also not required.  

***
###Course Format
***
This is a 4 credit seminar course. Seminar will be held once a week for a total of 3 hours. Please bring laptops or tablets to class loaded with appropriate software for course exercises (these can be found in Resources, above; packages required for the week will be noted in the Modules). Within CAS, these credits count as NS divisional credits towards the BA. This course is not (yet) integrated into the BU Hub.

***
###Assessment
***
Performance in the class will be assessed on a **gradeless** basis for the semester, with only a single final grade being assigned in consultation with each student. Assessment will entail the following assignments:
<ol>
1. Regular attendance and class participation.  
2. On-time completion of assigned [Modules](https://fuzzyatelin.github.io/bioanth-stats/modules.html) prior to seminar meetings.
3. Programming homework sets associated with each [Module](https://fuzzyatelin.github.io/bioanth-stats/modules.html), **due Thursday at 8:00 pm to your assigned [peer commentary partner](https://fuzzyatelin.github.io/bioanth-stats/peercommentary.html)**.
4. Respectful [Peer Commentary](https://fuzzyatelin.github.io/bioanth-stats/peercommentary.html) on homework coding, **to be submitted to me by 5:00pm Sunday**.
5. One individual [analysis replication assignment](https://fuzzyatelin.github.io/bioanth-stats/data_reanalysis_assignment.html) based on a published paper with a publicly available dataset, chosen in consultation with the instructor.  
6. One <b>group presentation and written R vignette</b> demonstrating the use of a particular statistical method chosen in consultation with the instructor (past examples available in the [Modules](https://fuzzyatelin.github.io/bioanth-stats/modules.html)).
7. A final report and assessment written by *you* arguing for the grade you have earned through your progress and the quality of your work in the class.

###Learning Objectives
***
By the end of this course, you should:
<ul>
<li>be familiar with key concepts and methods in applied data science for acquiring and managing data, conducting exploratory data analyses, testing statistical hypotheses, building models to classify and make predictions about data, and evaluating model performance;</li>

<li>have a facility with <b>modern tools for data analysis</b>, (e.g., the Unix command line, version control systems, the R programming environment, web APIs) and be able to apply "best practices" in data science;</li>

<li>know how to <b>interact with both local and remote data sources</b> to store, query, process, and analyze data presented a variety of common formats (e.g., delimited text files, structured text files, various database systems);</li>

<li>be comfortable <b>writing simple computer programs</b> for data management, statistical analysis, visualization, and more specialized applications;</li>

<li>know how to design and implement <b>reproducible data science workflows</b> that take a project from data acquisition to analysis to presentation and be able to organize your work using a version control system;</li>

<li>be able to <b>accurately assess, critique, and reproduce existing published works</b> utilizing public and open source data repositories and analytical techniques;</li>

<li>and be able to apply all of these tools to <b>questions of interest in the natural and social sciences</b>.</li></ul><br><br>
