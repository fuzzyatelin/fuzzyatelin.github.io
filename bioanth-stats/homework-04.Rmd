Create a new ***GitHub*** repo and git-referenced ***Rstudio*** Project called "**AN597_Malfunction_BUlogin**". Within that repo, create a new `.Rmd` file called "**BUlogin_OriginalHomeworkCode_04**". Don't forget to add your [Peer Group](https://fuzzyatelin.github.io/bioanth-stats/peercommentary.html) and instructor as collaborators, and to accept their invitations to you. Making sure to push both the markdown and knitted `.html` files to your repository, do the following:

### [1] Write a simple R function, `Z.prop.test()`, that can perform one- or two-sample Z-tests for proportion data, using the following guidelines:

- Your function should take the following arguments: **p1** and **n1** (no default) representing the estimated proportion and sample size (i.e., based on your sample data); **p2** and **n2** (both defaulting to NULL) that contain a second sample's proportion and sample size data in the event of a two-sample test; **p0** (no default) as the expected value for the population proportion; and **alternative** (default "two.sided") and **conf.level** (default 0.95), to be used in the same way as in the function `t.test()`.
- When conducting a two-sample test, it should be **p1** that is tested as being smaller or larger than **p2** when alternative="less" or alternative="greater", the same as in the use of x and y in the function `t.test()`.
- The function should perform a one-sample Z-test using **p1**, **n1**, and **p0** if either **p2** or **n2** (or both) is NULL.
- The function should contain a check for the rules of thumb we have talked about ($n * p > 5$ and $n * (1-p) > 5$) to ensure the validity of assuming the normal distribution in both the one- and two-sample settings. If this is violated, the function should still complete but it should also print an appropriate warning message.
- The function should return a list containing the members **Z** (the test statistic), **P** (the appropriate p value), and **CI** (the two-sided CI with respect to "conf.level" around **p1** in the case of a one-sample test and around **p2-p1** in the case of a two-sample test). For all test alternatives ("two.sided", "greater", "less"), calculate symmetric CIs based on quantiles of the normal distribution rather than worrying about calculating single-limit confidence bounds.

### [2] The dataset from Kamilar and Cooper has in it a large number of variables related to life history and body size. For this exercise, the end aim is to fit a simple linear regression model to predict longevity (`MaxLongevity_m`) measured in months from species' brain size (`Brain_Size_Species_Mean`) measured in grams. Do the following for both `longevity~brain size` and `log(longevity)~log(brain size)`:

- Fit the regression model and, using {ggplot2}, produce a scatterplot with the fitted line superimposed upon the data. Append the the fitted model equation to your plot (HINT: use the function `geom_text()`).
- Identify and interpret the point estimate of the slope ($\beta_1$), as well as the outcome of the test associated with the hypotheses H0: $\beta_1$ = 0; HA: $\beta_1$ â‰  0. Also, find a 90 percent CI for the slope ($\beta_1$) parameter.
- Using your model, add lines for the 90 percent confidence and prediction interval bands on the plot and add a legend to differentiate between the lines.
- Produce a point estimate and associated 90 percent PI for the longevity of a species whose brain weight is 800 gm. Do you trust the model to predict observations accurately for this value of the explanatory variable? Why or why not?
- Looking at your two models, which do you think is better? Why?

###**Your Final Assignment for Homework 03**

Your final assignment, due to me by 5:00 pm on October 10th, is to have in your *AN597_Zombies_BUlogin* repo only the following files:
<ol>
1. The *FINAL PUSH* of your Original Homework Code, including the five challenges you faced, as pushed to your repo by 8:00 pm on Thursday, an R Markdown file named *BUlogin_OriginalHomeworkCode_04*.
2. The *FINAL PUSH* of the [Peer Commentary](https://fuzzyatelin.github.io/bioanth-stats/peercommentary.html) made on *your* code, an R Markdown file named *Peerlogin_PeerCommentary_BUlogin_04* or *PeerGroupX_PeerCommentary_BUlogin_04*.
3. The *FINAL PUSH* of your Final Homework Code, which has taken into account any changes recommended from the Peer Commentary and notes, an R Markdown file named *BUlogin_FinalHomeworkCode_04*.
</ol>

###[Homework 04 Solutions]() will be posted on October 28th.

NOTE: If you want your homework code to look nice (beyond being *very* well annotated and commented), and be easy to use by others, you can check out the relatively simply example **R Markdown** templates in the [AN597_Week_3_caschmit](https://github.com/fuzzyatelin/AN597_Week_3_caschmit) repo.

Please also consider consulting the following helpful guidelines on how to write effective **R Markdown** documents (also available at the end of [Module 03](https://fuzzyatelin.github.io/bioanth-stats/module-03/module-03.html)), which go well beyond the simple formatting of the templates.
