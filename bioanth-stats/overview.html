Statistical methods are the backbone of scientific research, but are
often given short shrift when designing research in biological
anthropology. The purpose of this seminar is two-fold: 1) to familiarize
students with the use of relevant statistical programming packages
(primarily R), and 2) to discuss select advances in statistical
techniques from related disciplines that may help students while
designing and implementing their own research projects.</p>
<p>Potential foci of discussion may include statistical methods for
accounting for small sample sizes or non-normal data, using power
analyses and preliminary statistics to justify data collection design,
and the use of mixed models and information theoretic approaches to
analyze a number of different data types. Although there will be a
discussion element to the seminar, students should see this course as a
guided workshop or practicum in which we learn by working with both our
own and previously published datasets to better understand hypothesis
testing using statistical inference in biological anthropology.</p>
This course is open to students outside of Anthropology willing to learn
the methods involved. Past students include undergraduate and graduate
students from Anthropology, Archaeology, Biology, and Economics.

<h3><a href="http://www.bu.edu/hub/about-the-hub/">BU HUB</a> Learning
Outcomes (for enrolled undergraduates)</h3>
<hr />
<p>This course has been accepted to the <strong>BU HUB</strong>
Undergraduate General Education Curriculum as <strong>CAS AN/BI
588</strong>. It has several proposed Learning Outcomes related to its
assigned Hub Capacities, including:</p>
<hr />
<div id="scientific-inquiry-ii-si2" class="section level4">
<h4><em>Scientific Inquiry II (SI2)</em></h4>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><strong>Learning Outcome 1</strong>: Students in this course will
learn to identify and apply appropriate methods of statistical inference
to test hypotheses related to biological anthropology. This will de done
in the R programming framework using published or simulated datasets
from a number of scientific literatures, primarily from primate
morphology and behavior. Throughout the semester, students will use
these tests to appropriately frame and address established hypotheses in
biological anthropology using increasingly complex statistical methods,
including using t-tests to assess differences in body size between wild
and anthropogenically impacted vervet monkey groups, testing
hypothesized correlations between female body size and various life
history traits across primates using multiple regression, and assessing
shifts in male grooming attention towards periovulatory female
chimpanzees using generalized linear mixed modeling, among others. This
will culminate in a more advanced application of these methods by
engaging in the R-based replication of a published paper with open
access data in the student’s field of interest, and the development of
their own teaching module demonstrating a novel statistical method and
how it may be used to test a novel hypothesis in a new dataset. The
replication assignment will facilitate a hands-on, critical assessment
of how these authors used data processing, manipulation, analyses, and
figures to reach their published conclusions. The teaching module will
allow students to reflect critically on a novel method and how it might
be used (or may be misused) to inform a hypothetical framework of their
choosing in a novel dataset.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="quantitative-reasoning-ii-qr2" class="section level4">
<h4><em>Quantitative Reasoning II (QR2)</em></h4>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><strong>Learning Outcome 1</strong>: In this courses, students will
learn how to frame questions germane to biological anthropology through
the explicit testing of hypotheses using statistical inference. Using
the R statistical programming framework, students will explore the
underlying logic and mathematics of probability, hypothesis testing,
linear modeling and regression, ANOVA, multiple regression, generalized
linear modeling and mixed effects modeling, and then use these methods
to solve complex problems in biological anthropology with both real and
simulated data.</li>
<li><strong>Learning Outcome 2</strong>: Online, R-based statistical
modules guide students through the development and use of the above
methods in numerous datasets drawn from studies of wild primates and
museum specimens to test hypotheses central to biological anthropology
and evolutionary biology. These questions range from using the poisson
distribution to predict the frequency of titi monkey morning duets, to
using generalized linear modeling to assess whether male rank has an
impact on fitness outcomes in a population of woolly monkeys.</li>
<li><strong>Learning Outcome 3</strong>: With every statistical module
students will challenged to test established hypotheses using
statistical inference. They are then challenged in homework assignments
to investigate data structures and formulate and test their own
hypotheses using the statistical methods learned in class. This
culminates in a replication assignment from the primary literature, in
which students critically evaluate the methods and conclusion of a
published paper from the primary literature in their field.</li>
<li><strong>Learning Outcome 4</strong>: Through the use of GitHub-based
shared repositories and the R Markdown language, students will learn to
communicate via annotated coding chunks in data reports to explain their
logic and choice of statistical coding options to address bi-weekly
homework assignments and statistical module challenges. The Peer
Commentary of homework assignments requires that students engage with
each other to both improve their code and ensure that the symbolic,
visual, numerical, and written account of their data processing and
analysis are communicated effectively. The final assignments of the
class, a group-based homework module teaching a novel statistical test
not presented in the class and a replication of an analysis from the
primary literature, both encourage students to design legible and
engaging representations of the their data analysis process, and to
adequately communicate these methods both verbally and visually.</li>
<li><strong>Learning Outcome 5</strong>: Through an emphasis on testing
the assumptions underlying the statistical tests learned in class,
students will learn to recognize and articulate both the capacity and
limitations of these methods. This includes modules and discussions
testing data distributions and model residuals for normality, using
power tests to assess the effects of sample size and variance on
parameter estimation, assessing the appropriateness of link functions
for different data distributions in GLMMs, and more, complete with
demonstrations of what poorly analyzed data looks like, and how that may
negatively influence scientific inference.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="intellectual-toolkit-teamworkcollaboration-twc"
class="section level4">
<h4><em>Intellectual Toolkit: Teamwork/Collaboration (TWC)</em></h4>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><strong>Learning Outcome 1</strong>: Students will engage in
bi-weekly Peer Commentary assignments in which they must collaborate in
shared GitHub repositories to share, annotate, and comment on each
others’ coding-based homework assignments. These experiences will be
supplemented by readings and small tutorials on productive peer coding
and annotation practices. Students will share first drafts of homework,
commented code by a Peer, and their final code. In their final code,
students are encouraged to reflect on how the discussion and comments of
their Peers improved their code, and what remained to be solved. Peer
groups rotate throughout the course, so that students can identify and
learn the traits of effective collaboration and commentary, culminating
in choosing a group to develop and design an online teaching module for
a novel statistical technique to be taught to the rest of the class.
These comments will be critiqued and overseen in each bi-weekly session
by the instructor to ensure productive teamwork.</li>
<li><strong>Learning Outcome 2</strong>: In both the biweekly Peer
Commentary and the final group Module assignment, students will develop
and demonstrate an ability to use the tools and strategies of working
successfully with a diverse group, based on course readings meant to
foster productive peer review and coding practives. In each Module
assignment, students will guided towards explicitly assigning roles and
responsibilities to individual group members based on strengths
identified in the Peer Commentary process. Upon presentation of the
Module, in dialogue with the instructor, the class will assess the
effectiveness and clarity of the module in teaching the method in
question and offer productive suggestions for revision, making the
course itself an exercise in teamwork. Both Peer Commentary and final
Module assignment asks students to reflect on their role in the
collaborative process and what were effective practices using the
readings to guide these reflections.</li>
