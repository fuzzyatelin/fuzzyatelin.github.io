}
```

The SMAGL Laboratory Coordinator and Lab Safety Coordinator is **Samantha Kelley**. Sam is the Lab Coordinator for all the labs associated with the Department of Anthropology, and can help with any safety or equipment concerns in the lab, the ordering of necessary supplies and many other day-to-day lab tasks. 

She can be reached via phone (617-353-5521), email (srkell19@bu.edu) or in her office (STO 241).

## Postdoctoral Research Associates


[**Dr. Evelyn L. Pain**](https://evelynpain.weebly.com) is currently a **Postdoctoral Associate Teaching Scholar** in the Department of Biology affiliated with the Schmitt Lab, with a focus on our primate projects in Perú. Dr. Pain’s current office space is in BRB 511.

**Dr. Amy M. Scott** is a **Postdoctoral Research Associate** with the [Gunung Palung Orangutan Conservation Project](https://savegporangutans.org) and [Knott Lab](https://www.cherylknott.com) who will also be conducting research in the SMAGL. Dr. Scott’s current office space is in STO 250.

When PRAs are working with the lab, please keep in mind that they are professional scientists with extensive field and lab experience, who have already earned a Ph.D., and who already run research programs of their own in addition to the research they conduct in the SMAGL. We ask that you respect the authority of our PRAs as strongly as you respect that of Prof. Garrett or Prof. Schmitt.
