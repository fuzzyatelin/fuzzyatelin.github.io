By now, you’ve probably already spoken to at least one of the two Principal Investigators (PI) in the SMAGL: **Dr. Eva C. Garrett** and **Dr. Christopher A. Schmitt**.

If you need them, you can contact and learn more about the SMAGL PIs in the following ways:

[**Dr. Evelyn L. Pain**](https://evelynpain.weebly.com) is currently a **Postdoctoral Associate Teaching Scholar** in the Department of Biology affiliated with the Schmitt Lab, and Reserach Coordinator for the conservation NGO [Yunkawasi Perú](https://yunkawasiperu.org/en/). Her focus is on our primate projects in Perú, inclusing with yellow-tailed woolly monkeys (*Lagothrix flavicauda*) and Andean night monkeys (*Aotus miconax*). Dr. Pain’s current office space is in BRB 511.

**Dr. Amy M. Scott** is a **Postdoctoral Research Associate** with the [Gunung Palung Orangutan Conservation Project](https://savegporangutans.org) and [Knott Lab](https://www.cherylknott.com) who will also be conducting research in the SMAGL. She's currently working on extracting DNA from archived urine samples from wild Bornean orangutans (*Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii*). Dr. Scott’s current office space is in STO 250.

<br>

When PRAs are working with the lab, please keep in mind that they are professional scientists with extensive field and lab experience, who have already earned a Ph.D., and who already run research programs of their own in addition to the research they conduct in the SMAGL. We ask that you respect the authority of our PRAs as strongly as you respect that of Prof. Garrett or Prof. Schmitt. 


## Graduate Students


The SMAGL also trains graduate students at both the Master’s and Doctoral level. During your time in the SMAGL, one of the more senior graduate students may be assigned to be your immediate mentor.

Current graduate students you may meet include:
