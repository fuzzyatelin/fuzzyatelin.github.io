As we learned in class, ***LD*** is the non-random assortment of alleles at different loci across the genome. Linked alleles will frequently travel with each other during crossover events during meiosis, and if we know LD is high between two alleles is present in a population we can even use the frequency of one allele to predict the frequency of the other allele. Today, we will look at LD within *UCP1* in our own populations to get both a sense of the amount of linkage present within the gene, and what that linkage can tell us about our assigned population's history.
<br>

### Our Focal SNPs

In the [Ramos *et al*. (2012)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3526455/) paper that you read for this module, they looked at 3 SNPs within *UCP1* that were thought to be associated with obesity:  *rs6536991* (4:140560427), *rs2270565* (4:140562317) and *rs12502572* (4:140563980). The results of their analyses suggested that only *rs6536991* was directly associated with obesity in the Brazilian population under investigation. The other two alleles, however -  *rs2270565* and *rs12502572* - were found to be in various levels of linkage with *rs6536991*. We will take a closer look at these three SNPs in our own populations, as well as two other SNPs in *UCP1* called *rs3811787* (4:140569265) and the famous *rs1800592* (4:140572807), which [Cha *et al.* (2008)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1601-5223.2008.02071.x) found to be associated with abdominal fat stores in a population of Korean women. 
<br>

### A Note On *D'* and *r<sup>2</sup>*

We will be using two statistics to gauge LD in our populations: Lewontin's ***D'*** (pronounced 'D prime') and ***r<sup>2</sup>*** (pronounced 'r-squared'). Both of these are useful for determining the amount of linkage between two SNPs, but each statistic tells us something slightly different.<br> 

* *D'* is slightly easier to understand, as it simply is a measure of the predictability of one SNP's genotype based on the other. When *D'* = 1, the two SNPs are in perfect LD (meaning that they will *always* co-segregate, or be inherited together as a unit), and when *D'* = 0 the two SNPs are in Linkage Equilibrium (meaning that co-segregation is random, or around 50%).<br> 

* *r<sup>2</sup>* is a little bit different. This statistic will also take into account the *frequency* of the allele in question. If one SNP genotype is linked to another, but the linked genotype of one SNP is the *minor* allele (less common than the other genotype), the *r<sup>2</sup>* value will be *lower* than the *D'* value. This does not make the SNPs any less linked, but is rather taking into account the (lower) allele frequency. 

### Learning Outcomes

* Learn about the SNPs *rs6536991*, *rs2270565*, *rs12502572*, *rs3811787*, and *rs1800592* and their roles in human obesity.

* Learn how to use various *R* packages to perform LD analysis in a population, including constructing LD matrices and LD heatmaps.

* Learn about the two statistics *D'* and *r<sup>2</sup>*, which are the most commonly used statistics to evaluate LD between SNPs. Learn what each can tell us about a population, and apply the two statistics to our own populations.

* Learn how to use *EnsEMBL* to look at long-distance LD between SNPs in *UCP1*, as well as for SNPs in other genes.
<br>

## Step 1: Getting to *R Studio* and Preparing your Data

Log in to the *SCC On Demand* and bring up the *R Studio* window [like we did in the last module](https://fuzzyatelin.github.io/AN333_Fall24/Lab2_Module.html): 

Now that we're in *R*, we can prepare our data for analysis. The functions we will use today require our VCF data to be in a special format called a *SNPMatrix*, so we'll convert our data in to a *SNPMatrix* now. As usual, I will use the population YRI again as an example; change all YRI code to *your* population code! 
<br>

First, we'll need to install a few packages (remember to always say 'yes' to downloading dependencies!):
```{r,eval=F,echo=T}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install.packages("BiocManager")
library(BiocManager)
BiocManager::install("snpStats")
BiocManager::install("VariantAnnotation")
devtools::install_github("SFUStatgen/LDheatmap")
devtools::install_github("felix-clark/gpart")
install.packages("geneHapR")
```

And then we'll load the packages we will be using:
```{r, results='hide', message=F, warning=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(snpStats)
library(vcfR)
library(LDheatmap)
```
<br>
Next, we will load in our data, in this case the VCF file of the extended area of SNPs in *UCP1* (for me called ***UCP1_YRI_REGION.vcf***) in to our *R* space first, and then use another function to transform them into *SNPMatrices*.<br>

We'll start with the full *UCP1* file that you made for your Homework for Module 1 (which should include 5,000 or 10,000 bp up- and down-stream of the gene region itself. Remember to replace `YRI` with the acronym for *your* population, and `caschmit` with your own named directory:
```{r,eval=F,echo=T}
UCP1vcf <- read.vcfR("/projectnb/anth333/caschmit/UCP1_YRI_REGION.vcf")
```
```{r,eval=T,echo=F}
UCP1vcf <- read.vcfR("UCP1_YRI_REGION.vcf")
```

Next, we'll convert it to a *SNPMatrix*. Let's take a look: 

```{r}
UCP1matrix <- vcfR2SnpMatrix(UCP1vcf)
UCP1matrix #repeating the file name will show you what it looks like
```
<br>

You may notice that the output of the *UCP1matrix* gives us some information about our data. Under `$genetic.distances` you'll see that our *SNPMatrix* includes physical positions on the chromosome, and that our `$subjectID` is comprised of our sample names, while our genotype data are contained in the `$data` slot. You can use this information to count both how many SNPs and how many individuals are in your database. In my case, I've got 108 individuals in the YRI population, typed at 150 variants. Your population and variant count might differ, as when we created out VCF files we restricted to one sample population, and also cut out variant sites that were homogenous (i.e., had no variation across our individual populations).<br>
<br> 

## Step 2: Using the `ld` Function 

Next, we will be using a function from the {snpStats} package to look at LD across the *UCP1* gene. To do this, we will use the `ld` function to create an LD matrix, which we will then graph to comprehend better. First, we'll use the `ld` function, like so (you should set the `depth` number to one value *less* than the number of variants in your VCF file): 
<br>
```{r}
#For "Stats," use "R.squared" for now. We will explore D' later.
LD <- snpStats::ld(UCP1matrix$data, depth = 149, stats = "R.squared")
```
<br>
If you type `LD` into your console, you'll see the  large matrix of r<sup>2</sup> LD values you've just created, which is probably fairly confusing on first look. An LD analysis output like this can be hard to interpret without a visual aid, so let's build one! The output of this function (our `LD` object) is what we'll use as an input to visualize these LD values. 

```{r}
#sets color scale for the graph
cols = colorRampPalette(c("yellow", "red"))(10)
#building the image 
image(LD, lwd = 0, cuts= 9, col.regions=cols, colorkey=TRUE)
```

You can see from the figure here in the module that much of this gene in the YRI population shows very *low* LD (consulting the scale on the right, that would be the yellow regions), meaning that these regions are segregating randomly. The regions in *red* are those regions that have very *high* LD, suggesting non-random segregation. Large, contiguous regions of red are what we might call *linkage blocks*, or larger contiguous areas along the genome with consistently high linkage. What could this mean about these regions of the gene?  

## Step 3: Measuring LD in our SNPs of Interest

Now, we will look at our smaller dataset so we can focus on five SNPs in particular: *rs6536991* (4:140560427), *rs2270565* (4:140562317), *rs12502572* (4:140563980), *rs3811787* (4:140569265), and *rs1800592* (4:140572807). Now, three of these you read about in the homework as being either SNPs related to obesity, or in moderate linkage with obesity-related SNPs, in a Brazilian population; while the final two were associated with abdominal obesity in a Korean population of women. Let's see what they look like in *our* populations.
<br>
<br>
What we will be doing now is creating *two* LD heatmaps, one that displays the *r<sup>2</sup>* LD statistics and one that displays the *D'* LD statistics. As we discussed in the introduction, these two statistics don't tell us quite the same things about our data, so comparing the two statistics can be useful in making conclusions about LD in your populations.
<br>
<br>

Now, here is the code to create the LD heatmap showing the *r<sup>2</sup>* statistic (notice where I've entered the names of our SNPs of interest, to note their locations on the heatmap): 
<br>
```{r}
R2heatmapUCP1 <- LDheatmap(UCP1matrix$data,
                           genetic.distances=UCP1matrix$genetic.distances,
                           distances="physical",
                           LDmeasure="r",
                           title="Pairwise LD in UCP1 for YRI using R^2",
                           add.map=TRUE, add.key=TRUE,
                           geneMapLocation=0.15,
                           SNP.name=c("4:140560427:T:C", "4:140562317:T:A",
                                      "4:140563980:G:A", "4:140569265:T:G",
                                      "4:140572807:T:C"),
                           color=NULL, newpage=TRUE,
                           name="UCP1 LD Heatmap (R^2)")
```
<br><br>

This looks nice, but it's still pretty difficult to see LD blocks... if you want to prettify your LD heatmap, you can check out [this resource here](https://sfustatgen.github.io/LDheatmap/reference/LDheatmap.html), which is where I got the code for the color modifications, below (which I find easier to read than grayscale or yellow/red). You can see the codes and how they modify the heatmap as I move along, below:
```{r,results="hide",message=F}
#This code establishes the color palette for the heatmap
rgb.palette <- colorRampPalette(rev(c("grey85", "green", "darkgreen")), space = "rgb")

#This code will save the subsequent plot
png(filename="R2heatmapUCP1_YRI.png",units="in",res=600,width=6,height=5)

#Here's the code for the heatmap itself
R2heatmapUCP1 <- LDheatmap(UCP1matrix$data,
                           genetic.distances=UCP1matrix$genetic.distances,
                           distances="physical",
                           LDmeasure="r",
                           title="Pairwise LD in UCP1 for YRI using R^2",
                           add.map=TRUE, add.key=TRUE,
                           geneMapLocation=0.15,
                           SNP.name=c("4:140560427:T:C", "4:140562317:T:A",
                                      "4:140563980:G:A", "4:140569265:T:G",
                                      "4:140572807:T:C"),
                           color=rgb.palette(18), newpage=TRUE,
                           name="R2heatmapUCP1")

#There is USUALLY a way to add the gene map to this... but UCSC Genome Browser recently changed they way their website works, so this is broken, for now.
#addGenes <- LDheatmap.addGenes(R2heatmapUCP1, chromosome="chr4",genome="hg38")
#addRecomb <- LDheatmap.addRecombRate(R2heatmapUCP1, chr="chr4", genome="hg38")

#Here we're editing the symbols
grid::grid.edit("symbols", pch = 16, gp = grid::gpar(cex = 0.5,col="darkgreen"))
#And here we're editing the SNP names
grid::grid.edit("SNPnames", gp = grid::gpar(cex=0.75,col="darkgreen"))
#and this closes the plot
dev.off()
```

We can also add in an outline of the gene region, if that helps you to imagine where exactly all this LD is occurring:
```{r,results="hide",message=F}
#This code establishes the color palette for the heatmap
rgb.palette <- colorRampPalette(rev(c("grey85", "green", "darkgreen")), space = "rgb")

#Here's the code for the heatmap itself
R2heatmapUCP1 <- LDheatmap(UCP1matrix$data,
                           genetic.distances=UCP1matrix$genetic.distances,
                           distances="physical",
                           LDmeasure="r",
                           title="Pairwise LD in UCP1 for YRI using R^2",
                           add.map=TRUE, add.key=TRUE,
                           geneMapLocation=0.15,
                           SNP.name=c("4:140560427:T:C", "4:140562317:T:A",
                                      "4:140563980:G:A", "4:140569265:T:G",
                                      "4:140572807:T:C"),
                           color=rgb.palette(18), newpage=TRUE,
                           name="R2heatmapUCP1")

```

![](R2heatmapUCP1_YRI_Gene.png)


As you can see on first glance, there is *potentially* one large linkage block in the *UCP1* region of the YRI population, starting downstream (beyond the end) of the gene region. Remember, *UCP1* is on the reverse strand, so the gene is read from higher positions to lower positions, meaning that positions lower than the lowest numner in the gene's position range are are *downstream* of the gene). It also looks like there may be a few small regions of LD in the *upstream* region of the gene, near our regulatory SNPs from the Cha *et al.* (2008) paper... one immediately upstream of the gene (in what may be the promoter region), and one much further.

There are a few things we can do to figure out exactly where these significant regions of LD actually are beyond just eyeballing them...

Maybe the easiest is a tool in the {gpart} package called `BigLD`, which will help us statistically identify the positions of independent linkage blocks in our gene region:
```{r,message=F,warning=F,eval=F}
library(gpart)
ucp1_res = BigLD(genofile = "/projectnb/anth333/caschmit/UCP1_YRI_REGION.vcf",LD="r2")
ucp1_res
```
```{r,message=F,warning=F,eval=T,echo=F}
library(gpart)
ucp1_res = BigLD(genofile = "UCP1_YRI_REGION.vcf",LD="r2")
ucp1_res
```
As you can see, {gpart} has identified *four* significant blocks of LD in the YRI population across our *UCP1* gene region... let's take a look at where these regions are by mapping them onto our `LDheatmap` object:
```{r}
#This code establishes the color palette for the heatmap
rgb.palette <- colorRampPalette(rev(c("grey85", "green", "darkgreen")), space = "rgb")

#This code will save the subsequent plot (notice the name change!)
png(filename="R2heatmapUCP1_YRI_LDblocks.png",units="in",res=600,width=6,height=5)

#Here's the code for the heatmap itself (nothing's changed here):
R2heatmapUCP1 <- LDheatmap(UCP1matrix$data,
                           genetic.distances=UCP1matrix$genetic.distances,
                           distances="physical",

                           geneMapLocation=0.15,
                           SNP.name=c("4:140560427:T:C", "4:140562317:T:A",
                                      "4:140563980:G:A", "4:140569265:T:G",
                                      "4:140572807:T:C"),
                           color=rgb.palette(18), newpage=TRUE,

The first, which runs from positions 140554683-140568842, appears to represent that first block we can visually identify in the downstream region of the heatmap; it contains our three SNPs we learned about from Ramos *et al.*, and indeed also contains almost the entire gene region (remember, *UCP1* runs from 140559431-140568961 on the reverse strand) and its downstream enhancer region (which runs from 140556002-140559199). 

The second linkage block, which runs from 140569304-140569826, is immediately upstream of the coding region for *UCP1*, and may represent the promoter, which runs from 140568951-140569599. How do I know that's where the promoter is? It's on *EnsEMBL*! You can see the promoter, enhancers, and their associated positions in the **Region in Detail** view on the human *UCP1* gene page. As you can see, the -412A>C variant site (rs3811787) from the Cha *et al.* (2008) paper is right near the promoter, which might explain how it affects *UCP1* function: if one of the variants at that locus alters how the promoter initiates transcription of *UCP1*, it could change *UCP1* expression.

Although the other two linkage blocks further upstream from the gene are not annotated on *EnsEMBL*, the final locus from the Cha *et al.* (2008) paper also gives us a clue regarding what these linkage blocks might represent: the larger of the two contains the famous regulatory locus Cha *et al.* identified as also having a large impact on abdominal obesity in Koren women, -3826A>G (rs1800592), suggesting that these may also be either full regulatory regions for *UCP1* that have not yet been identified as such, or that there may be LD in these areas due to selection on the regulatory effects of variants in these regions on *UCP1* function.

Next, we'll calculate and visualize LD using the *D'* statistic:

                           color=rgb.palette(18), newpage=TRUE,
                           name="UCP1 LD Heatmap (D')")

#Highlight UCP1 gene region... remember, it's 4:140559431-140568961. In my SNPMatrix, this translates to rows 35-93; it may translate to *different* rows in your own!:

grid.edit("symbols", pch = 16, gp = gpar(cex = 0.5,col="red"))

grid.edit("SNPnames", gp = gpar(cex=0.75,col="red"))
#and this closes the plot
dev.off()
```

Notice that measuring linkage using D' appears to be fundamentally different... it looks like there is high LD across the entire chosen gene region!

Let's take a look using {gpart}:
```{r,message=F,warning=F,echo=T,eval=F}
ucp1_res1 = BigLD(genofile = "/projectnb/anth333/caschmit/UCP1_REGION_YRI.vcf", LD="Dprime")
print(ucp1_res1,max.print=T)
```
```{r,message=F,warning=F,echo=F,eval=T}
ucp1_res1 = BigLD(genofile = "UCP1_YRI_REGION.vcf", LD="Dprime")
print(ucp1_res1,max.print=T)
```

Here, we can see that, using the *D'* measure, the `BigLD` algorithm has divided the *UCP1* genomic region for the YRI population into 8 distinct linkage blocks, giving us both starting and ending positions for each.  Using the row number (1-8) to name them, which linkage block(s) contain our SNPs of interest? Are any of our SNPs now in different linkage blocks than before?  

Let's take a look (for this plot, I'll make the highlighted linkage blocks solid so that they can be seen better):
```{r,results="hide",message=F}
#This code establishes the color palette for the heatmap

Now you've got several graphs that you can use to investigate LD in *your* population's gene region! You can see specifically whether or not the SNPs of interest (the labelled SNPs) are in LD by finding where on the graph their paths intersect, or by looking for their linkage block by position in the LD block analysis output. 

Now, for the purpose of reporting your pairwise LD results, we can look at something called an *LD matrix*, which is automatically generated by the `LDheatmap` function. This is a matrix where the row and column names are SNP ID numbers, and the cell at the intersection of a row and a column will tell you the LD statistic for those two particular SNPs. For our purposes, you do not need to look at the whole chart, you just need to find the intersections of our five SNPs of interest to see if any of them are in LD, and what that LD value is for each respective statistical test. 
<br>
<br>
To view your reduced LD matrices, run these two chunks of code separately: 
<br>

```{r}
#for R squared LD heatmap: 
R2LD<-as.data.frame(R2heatmapUCP1$LDmatrix)
snp<-rownames(R2LD)

R2LD<-
  R2LD %>%
  mutate(snp = snp) %>%
  dplyr::select(snp,"4:140560427:T:C","4:140562317:T:A","4:140563980:G:A","4:140569265:T:G","4:140572807:T:C") %>%
  filter(snp == "4:140560427:T:C" |
         snp == "4:140562317:T:A" |
         snp == "4:140563980:G:A" |
         snp == "4:140569265:T:G" |
         snp == "4:140572807:T:C")
R2LD
```

```{r}
#for D prime LD heatmap: 
DpLD<-as.data.frame(DheatmapUCP1$LDmatrix)
snp<-rownames(DpLD)

DpLD<-
  DpLD %>%
  mutate(snp = snp) %>%
  dplyr::select(snp,"4:140560427:T:C","4:140562317:T:A","4:140563980:G:A","4:140569265:T:G","4:140572807:T:C") %>%
  filter(snp == "4:140560427:T:C" |
         snp == "4:140562317:T:A" |
         snp == "4:140563980:G:A" |
         snp == "4:140569265:T:G" |
         snp == "4:140572807:T:C")
DpLD
```

Does LD appear to correlate with physical distance among these SNPs, according to your LDheatmap images?


## Step 4: Using *EnsEMBL* to Look for More SNPs in LD 

The last thing we'll do in this lab is look at *EnsEMBL*'s information on LD for each of the SNPs we studied today in your populations. <br>
To do this: 
<br>

* Go to [*EnsEMBL*](https://useast.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Info/Index) and search for *UCP1* in the Human search bar as we have done before

* Use the left sidebar to navigate to the *Variant Table*:
<br>

![](img/variantpage.png)
<br><br>

* Pick one of the variants we looked at today (*rs6536991* (4:140560427), *rs2270565* (4:140562317), *rs12502572* (4:140563980), *rs3811787* (4:140569265), and *rs1800592* (4:140572807)) and enter it in the *Variant Table* search bar. Make note of what kind of consequence each SNP has. What does the consequence mean, and how might the consequence of a SNP affect its LD?

![](img/variantsearch.png)

* Click on the Variant ID of the SNP you searched to get the SNP page. Click on the "*Linkage Disequilibrium*" tab under "*Explore This Variant*"
<br>

![](img/snppageLD.png)
<br>

* You will get this page. This should look familiar, because we visited it briefly in our introductory module. You will get a page like this that has LD plots of the SNP for all of the 1000 Genomes populations. 
<br>

![](img/LDBlock.png)
<br>

* You can play around with the LD calculator and the LD plots, but the first thing you should do is find *your* population in the table and click on the "*show*" button for "*Variants in High LD*". You will get this: 
<br>

![](img/highLD.png)
<br>

* Some populations will have more SNPs in high LD than others. Look specifically at the SNPs in high LD that are *not* in *UCP1*. In the example above, there's a SNP (*rs2321273*) listed in the gene *ELMOD2* in high linkage with a variant in *UCP1*. 

* Repeat this process for all five SNPs we looked at in today's module Where are the high LD SNPs that aren't in *UCP1* located? Are any of them located in other gene regions? 

## Step 6: What Do Your Results Mean? Discuss with a partner from class: 

Think about the results you produced today in the context of your population. Here are some guiding questions to help you: 
<br>

* What does it mean for two SNPs in your population to be in LD? How could two obesity-related SNPs being in LD reflect selection in that population? 

* Would you expect a high level of LD to develop in *UCP1* in your population based on its ecological context? Why or why not? 

* What would LD between two UCP1-related SNPs tell you about the evolutionary history of your population? 

* If you found any SNPs in high LD with our *UCP1* SNPs during the *EnsEMBL* exercise that are in a different gene, do a quick [OMIM](http://omim.org/) search on the gene(s). What does that gene code for? How might it be connected to *UCP1*?
