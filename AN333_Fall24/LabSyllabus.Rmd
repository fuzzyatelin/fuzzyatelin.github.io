**October 4**<br>

***

**Material covered**: Using *R* and *RStudio* via the *SCC* to run pre-written code that will perform our analyses. Assessing allelic variation in SNPs within and across populations. Testing **Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE)** and understanding what it means if violated, which involves knowing the assumptions of the model. Using downloaded candidate region data from 1000 Genomes Project to assess HWE in living human populations using a Chi-Squared test. Using *EnsEMBL* to obtain genotype count information in order to use the Wigginton and Cutler method of HWE calculation on selected SNPs.<br><br>

**Activities**: We will use the *R* coding language to test HWE in the dataset on *ACE2* we downloaded from *EnsEMBL*. We will assess whether or not SNPs in this genomic region are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium based on a Chi-Squared test in assigned human populations. We will then re-test selected SNPs using the "True HWE" method described in Wigginton and Cutler. We will then discuss what our results mean, in accordance with what we know about those populations, HWE, and the effects of these *UCP1* variants on trait expression.<br><br>

**October 25th**<br>

***

**Material covered**: In this module, we'll be using Nearest-Neighbor Joining to see which individuals within our assigned 1000 Genomes populations are most related to each other (at least insofar as *UCP1* variation indicates).

### [*Module 5: Neutrality Statistics, Haplotype Homozygosity, and Signs of Selection*](https://fuzzyatelin.github.io/AN333_Fall24/Lab5_Module.html)
**November 8th**<br>

***

**Material covered**: This module is an introduction to statistical tests of *neutrality* that can be used in genomic studies. *Tajima’s D*, *Fu and Li’s D and F*, and *iHS scores* will be covered and discussed. We'll work towards understanding what each of these tests do to measure selection, and what these statistics can tell us about population structure and history.

**Activities**: We'll use the packages *PopGenome* and *pegas* to cauclate Fu and Li’s D and F, as well as Tajima’s D for the *UCP1* region in our respective 1000 Genomes populations. We'll also look for positive selective sweeps in each of our 1000 Genomes populations using iHS score and EHH using the *rehh* package. Finally, we will take ample time to understand what the Fu and Li’s D and F and Tajima’s D test results tell us about how our populations are evolving, and use the example of iHS to predict whether or not our populations underwent a positive selective sweep in the *UCP1* region. <br><br>

### [*Module 6: A Brief Digression from COVID-19 for Quantitative Genetics*](https://fuzzyatelin.github.io/AN333_Fall24/Lab6_Module.html)
**November 15**<br>

***

**Material covered**: Quantitative genetics and partitioning variance in phenotypes between genetic and environmental signals. To do this, we'll be working with some captive vervet monkey (*Chlorocebus sabaeus*) data I collected at Wake Forest College of Medicine's Vervet Research Colony (VRC). We'll also learn about the *SOLAR* work environment, which is a (relatively) easy interface for doing quantitative genetics analysis in the *SCC* space. Through this, we'll learn a bit about the quantitative genetics of BMI and body mass.

<br>
**Activities**: There will be a brief discussion of quantitative genetics and the vervet monkey (*Chlorocebus sabaeus*) model as implemented in *SOLAR* using the Almasy & Blangero terminology and orientation to using *SOLAR* in the *SCC* environment. We will conduct in class exercises that will be used to answer questions in the Module 6 homework. <br><br>

<li>Learn how to use the program *SOLAR* (in the *SCC* framework).</li>
<li>Learn how to transform data to meet quantitative genetics model assumptions.</li>

### [*Module 7: Finding a New Locus…*](https://fuzzyatelin.github.io/AN333_Fall24/Lab7_Module.html)
**November 8**<br>

***

**Material covered**: We'll discuss the process of finding a new locus on which to conduct a population genetics study for your final project! Make sure the locus is related somehow to a trait you're really interested in, and also preferably a trait that varies among contemporary human populations. A *candidate gene* for a particular trait would be great (i.e., a gene that's been noted to perhaps be associated with a trait in a GWAS, but hasn't really been tested across populations that vary in that trait). A trait that's been noted to have been under selection previously would be great, but is by no means necessary.

<br>
**Activities**: We will go over a brief tutorial on how to think about finding a new locus of interest to study on your own, and we will have a class discussion on final project topic ideas.<br><br>
**Assignment**: Students must choose a gene of interest for their final project by the following **Friday, November 15**.
**Learning Outcomes**:<ul>
<li>Learn how to use the resources provided to you in this class to find a new genetic locus for study.</li>
<li>Assess the merits/flaws of using a candidate gene approach to understand trait histories in human populations.</li><br><br>
