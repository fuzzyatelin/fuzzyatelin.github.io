Now that many of us have a little more facility with working with *Ensembl* and 1000 Genomes data, I'm hoping this week's lab homework will be fairly simple. Don't forget: for more conceptual questions, you can consult both your notes/slides from lecture and the textbook!

As before, you'll be turning in your homework via an online interface.  I recommend writing your essays in a document on your laptop and only engaging with the online interface when you're ready to turn in *all* of your completed answers.

* What does it mean if there is a SNP in the gene *UCP1* that is not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium? Think not only about the phenotypic consequences, but what it says about the environment of the population.

* How many SNPs in *your* population were *out* of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium?

* Please list each of the four SNPs you chose to check for "true" Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium using the *Shiny App* embedded in the Lab 2 tutorial. What was the P-value of each using the *R* analysis? What was the modified P-value using the *Shiny App*? Did any of them change significance? Based on the Lab 2 tutorial and the Wigginton et al. (2005) reading, what does a change in P-value mean?

* Imagine that gene map above represents *UCP1*. Based on the Rose et al. (2011) article, where on the map is the SNP A-3826G? How could the placement of this SNP affect *UCP1* phenotype?

* Where on the map above is the SNP in *your* population that most significantly deviates from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium? How would that SNP affect *UCP1* phenotype? If you don't have any SNPs that deviate, choose one at random. 

* Think about your population. Would it make sense for your population's *UCP1* genotype/phenotype to be influenced by evolutionary forces in the present day? Why or why not?
