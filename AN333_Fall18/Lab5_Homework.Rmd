For our homework, we'll be doing a little more work with neutrality statistics and using them to detect selection in genomic regions.

As before, you'll be turning in your homework via an online interface.  I recommend writing your essays in a document on your laptop and only engaging with the online interface when you're ready to turn in *all* of your completed answers in a single submission.<br>
