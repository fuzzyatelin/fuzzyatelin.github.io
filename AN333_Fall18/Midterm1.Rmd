## Midterm 1 (100 points)

This midterm is **open notes, open textbook, open Lab tutorial** and will cover genetics review concepts, discrete vs. continuous traits, single vs. multiple alleles in populations,  the organization of the genome, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and linkage disequilibrium. <br>

You may begin the exam when the submission link (below) becomes active on **Wednesday, October 10**, and work on the exam until the link closes at midnight of the exam due date, **Wednesday, October 17**.<br>

*No late responses will be accepted!*<br><br>

###[Access the online interface to submit your Midterm 1 answers here.](https://goo.gl/forms/RVvIHblrcv75v58M2)
</center><br>

Parts of this exam will require downloading, processing, and analyzing data from *Ensembl* in ways that should, by now, be familiar to you; these may involve interfacing with *R/R Studio*, *tabix*, *vcftools*, and other modules in the *SCC*. If you've forgotten how to use these modules, you should use your online Lab tutorials as guides (this is an open notes exam, after all).<br>

All *SCC*-based files associated with exam analyses should be uploaded to a folder in the general *anth333* project space. Doing this will be part of the exam, and involves commands you've already learned and used in the context of class.<br>

NOTE: I will *not* help you directly with exam questions in office hours. However, I *will* help you with exercises already present on Lab tutorials or previous homework assignments. *Please do not ask for help on exam questions*. Also, although you are encouraged to do your homework in cooperation with other students, you should be doing your take-home exam *alone*.<br>

***

###Part 1: Preparing a Workspace for Genomic Data Analysis (5 points)

<ol>1. Log in to your *SCC* working directory. **(1 point)**<br><br> 

Once there, enter the following code:

```{bash, eval = F, echo = T}
#this gives you access to a shared project space on the SCC that I can access.
cd /project/anth333/
```
</ol><br>
<ol>2. Create a new directory in this *anth333* shared project space named after your BU login. For example, my directory would be called *caschmit*, which is both my BUID and my *SCC* login name. **(2 points)**</ol><br>

<ol>3. Now, navigate to your newly named directory so that it's your current directory (i.e., where all of the files you download from *Ensembl* will be deposited and saved). *Conduct all work for the midterm from this directory*. At the end of the exam, all your newly created or saved files associated with Midterm 1 *must* be in this folder. **(2 points)**<br><br>

HINT: Given you answered these first questions correctly, your *SCC* prompt will look like this for all midterm analyses:

```{bash, eval = F, echo = T}
[username@scc1 username]$
```

Now, all of the analyses and processing you do will be done *within* this single named directory, allowing me to grade your individual progress.</ol>

###Part 2: Downloading, Processing, and Discussing a Novel Gene in a Continuous Trait from Human Genomic Data on *Ensembl* (50 points)

So far in our labs, we've been focusing on the human mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (*UCP1*) gene.<br><br> 

<ol>1. According to Gonzalez-Barroso et al. (2000), in what tissue is the protein *UCP1* exclusively expressed? **(2 points)**

<ol>a) White adipose tissue</ol>

<ol>b) The thyroid</ol>

<ol>c) Brown adipose tissue</ol>

<ol>d) The hypothalamus</ol>

</ol><br>

<ol>2. What environmental circumstances cause *UCP1* to become expressed? **(2 points)**

<ol>a) High stress conditions</ol>

<ol>b) Cold temperatures</ol>

<ol>c) High humidity</ol>

<ol>d) Hot temperatures</ol>

</ol><br>

<ol>3. What is the best way to describe the metabolic function of *UCP1*? **(2 points)**

<ol>a) It uses body heat to increase fat stores</ol>

<ol>b) It helps you to dissipate heat, and in that way cool off</ol>

<ol>c) It literally burns fat to make body heat</ol>

<ol>d) It makes you shiver, so that you generate more heat</ol>

</ol><br>

Given its role in metabolic function, some have proposed that *UCP1* could be one of the many hundreds of genes hypothesized to be implicated in common obesity phenotypes; indeed, some variants have been shown to be related to obesity.<br><br>

<ol>4. Traits like common obesity, in which tens to hundreds of genes contribute incrementally small amounts of variation to the distribution of the phenotype, are called what? **(2 points)**

<ol>a) Monogenic</ol>

<ol>b) Oligogenic</ol>

<ol>c) Polygenic</ol>

<ol>d) Discrete</ol>

</ol><br>

<ol>5. Such complex traits often follow a normal distribution. Which of the following are characteristics of the normal distribution? **(2 points)**

<ol>a) Trait values are distributed symmetrically about the mean</ol>

<ol>b) The variance in trait values is the average of the squared difference of each value from the mean</ol>

<ol>c) About 68% of the sample is within 1 standard deviation from the mean</ol>

<ol>d) It shows high levels of skew</ol>

</ol><br>

<ol>6. Which of the two foundational scientists we've discussed in this course contributed to how we think about and analyze continuous variation in complex traits, and was the first to characterize the normal distribution? **(2 points)**

<ol>a) Gregor Mendel</ol>

<ol>b) Sir Francis Galton</ol>

<ol>c) Charles Darwin</ol>

<ol>d) Leslea Hlusko</ol>

</ol><br>

<ol>7. The basic equation for a *regression* line is ***y = mx + b***. If we were to use regression to discover the relationship between variation at a SNP in *UCP1* and body mass, what would each component of that equation represent?  Use one term each to match the parameter to what it represents:  **(4 points)**
<br><br>
<ol><ol>Body mass    |    SNP error    |    SNP alleles    |    The intercept    |    Mean mass    |    The slope </ol></ol>
<br><br>

<ol>y:</ol>

<ol>m:</ol>

<ol>x:</ol>

<ol>b:</ol>

</ol><br>

<ol>8. In the regression above, which parameter is what we would look at to  see the relationship between body mass and changes in SNP allele? **(2 points)**

<ol>a) y</ol>

<ol>b) m</ol>

<ol>c) x</ol>

<ol>d) b</ol>

</ol><br>

Despite its unique role in thermogenesis, *UCP1* is not an entirely unique gene. There are actually *multiple* mitochondrial uncoupling proteins found in the human genome. For the purposes of this exam, we'll focus on a *paralog* of *UCP1* called *UCP3*, which has also been implicated in thermoregulatory adaptations in humans.<br>

Open *firefox* from your *SCC* workspace and look up *UCP3* in the most recent human reference genome (Human GRCh38.p12) on *Ensembl*. Answer the following questions based on both information you learned in lecture and information you see specifically on the *UCP3* page:<br><br>

<ol>9. If *UCP3* is a *paralog* of *UCP1*, it most likely represents what kind of larger-scale variation in the genome? **(2 points)**

<ol>a) transposable element</ol>

<ol>b) microsatellite</ol>

<ol>c) copy number variant (CNV)</ol>

<ol>d) variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR)</ol>

</ol><br>

<ol>10. Is *UCP3* on the same chromosome as *UCP1*? **(1 point)**

<ol>a) Yes</ol>

<ol>b) No</ol>

</ol><br>

<ol>11. Is it possible for *UCP3* to show linkage with *UCP1*? **(2 points)**

<ol>a) Yes</ol>

<ol>b) No</ol>

</ol><br>

<ol>12. *UCP1* has no splice variants, meaning that the coding region of the gene can only be transcribed to make *one* functional protein. Scroll down to the interactive map for *UCP3*. How many splice variants are there for *UCP3* (in other words, how many protein transcripts are known to be made from the *UCP3* coding region by alternative splicing)? **(2 points)**

<ol>a) 1</ol>

<ol>b) 2</ol>

<ol>c) 4</ol>

<ol>d) 7</ol>

</ol><br>

<ol>13. What is the *location* of *UCP3* in the human genome (i.e., on which chromosome, and at what base-pair position does the gene region start and end). Answer in the standard format: [chromosome number]**:**[start-position]**-**[end-position]. **(3 points)**</ol><br><br>

The 1000 Genomes Project is a comprehensive dataset of variation that we've been working with all semester.<br><br>

<ol>14. According to the 1000 Genomes Project Consortium (2015), how many individuals have been sequenced in Phase 3 of the project? **(2 points)**</ol><br>

<ol>15. According to the 1000 Genomes Project Consortium (2015), which *Chinese* population shows the highest number of variants common to that population but that were rare in the rest of the world (HINT: see Figure 3)? Please use the 3-letter population acronym for your answer. **(2 points)**</ol><br>

<ol>16. Take a closer look at Figure 3 in the 1000 Genomes Project Consortium (2015) paper. Which of the following genes appear to have been under strong selection in the Chinese population you chose in your previous answer. **(2 points)**</ol><br>

<center>*IGHA2*  |  *CMYA5*  |  *LILRB2*  |  *IGHE*  |  *TRBV9*  |  *FADS1*  |  None of the above</center>   <br></ol> 

Now, we're going to download the *UCP3* data just for the **Chinese Dai in Xishuangbanna, China** from the 1000 Genomes project dataset.<br><br> 

<ol>17. What is the three-letter code for the Chinese Dai in Xishuangbanna, China population in the 1000 Genome project dataset? **(1 point)**</ol><br>

<ol>18. Download the variant data for *UCP3* only for the Chinese Dai in Xishuangbanna, China population using the same procedure we used for *UCP1*. As in [Lab 1](Lab_1_-_1KG_and_Ensembl_Tutorial.html), you can try first using the *Data Slicer* (the ***Data Slicer WINS!*** tab in Lab 1). If the *Data Slicer* isn't working, you must use the either the modified *Data Slicer* method (the ***Data Slicer SUCKS!*** tab in Lab 1) or the *tabix* code (the ***It's TABIX time...*** tab in Lab 1).<br><br>

If you're forced to use the latter methods, you will need the proper data URL:

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/supporting/GRCh38_positions/ALL.chr11_GRCh38.genotypes.20170504.vcf.gz
```

The rest of the code will be the same as in the Lab 1 tutorial (modified, of course, with the position of *UCP3* and specific to the Chinese Dai in Xishuangbanna, China population). **(15 points)**

**Please keep all files associated with this process in your personal *anth333* folder, created in Part 1 of this exam!**</ol><br>

###Part 3: Understanding Variation Within Genes, and Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (50 points)

For this section of the exam, we'll take a closer look at the variation present within the *UCP3* region of the Chinese Dai in Xishuangbanna, China. Answer the following questions based on both information you learned in lecture and information you see specifically on the *UCP3* page on *Ensembl* and through your own analyses of the dataset you just downloaded.<br>

Prior to answering these questions, please repeat the analyses from [Lab 2](https://fuzzyatelin.github.io/AN333_Fall18/Lab_2_-_HWE.html) on the *UCP3* region of the genome in the population of Chinese Dai in Xishuangbanna, China. Remember to do all analyses from, and save all files to, your named directory in the shared *anth333* project space created in Part 1 of this midterm.<br>

<ol>1. Open your VCF file using the `less` command in your SCC space. What is the ID of the first human sample listed for this population? **(2 points)**</ol><br>
