**September 21**<br>

***

**Material covered**: Introduction to and tutorial on using the BU Shared Computing Cluster, via Linux-based SCC.<br>
**Readings**: None.<br>
**Activities**: We will create personal profiles using the SCC interface with the help of a representative from Research Computing. Weâ€™ll learn how to connect to SCC and some basic commands that will help us navigate the interface and access analytical software that will be used in the course.<br>
**Assignment**: In-class worksheet based on activities will be graded.<br>
**Learning Outcomes**:
<ul>
<li>Learn how to access your SCC profile and data storage, and become familiar with analytical software and data download and storage commands.</li>
<li>Learn basic command-line tools, vocabulary, and syntax.</li>
<li>Learn how to access analytical software such as R and RStudio, which we will be using to do real-
life population genetic analyses.</li>
<li>If we have time, we will begin using these tools to get a head start on Lab 1!</li></ul>
